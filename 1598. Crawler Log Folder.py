#The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.
#The operations are described below:
#"../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
#"./" : Remain in the same folder.
#"x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
#You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.
#The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.
#Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.
